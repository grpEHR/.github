# About

grp-EHR is a group of interdisciplinary scientists consisting of medical statisticians, epidemiologists and health data scientists from the Universities of Bristol, Cambridge, Plymouth and Leicester. The group formed during the COVID-19 pandemic to address urgent, policy-relevant questions using linked electronic health record data. From the beginning, the group has embraced “team science” and adopted open science practices.
